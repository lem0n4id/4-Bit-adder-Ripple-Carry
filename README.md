# **4-Bit-adder-Ripple-Carry**

## **Description:**
I've implemented a **4 Bit Adder**, inspired by [Ben Eater's Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJc9CZcvBc).

## **What's in here:**

In this repo you'll find the Logic circuit scematics of the [4 Bit adder](/resourses/4_bit_adder.circ). 

I've made it using [original Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) but i recommend you to use logisim-evolution which you can find [here](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). 

Note that you will need to import **Logi7400ic** library which you can find [here](https://github.com/r0the/logi7400)

## **Components used:**
+ 74LS08 (AND GATE)
+ 74LS86 (XOR GATE)
+ 74LS32 (OR GATE)
+ 4 way DIP Switch
+ Slide Switch 
+ LEDs
+ Resistors
+ Breadboard wires

## **My Experience-**

This was a great Introduction and Hands-on experience with Digital Circuits.

Ben Eater's understanding with how things work really inspires me. 

His 8 bit breadboard computer is just too cool to not build it. Do check out **[his content on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA)** and his dedicated **[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater)** which is filled with enthusiasts.
